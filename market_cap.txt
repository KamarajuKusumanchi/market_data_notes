====== market cap ======
Created Monday 05 December 2022

--------------------
There are five basic groups based on a stock's percentile within total market cap of all stocks: mega-cap (the top 40% of stocks by market cap), large-cap (the next 30% of stocks by market cap), mid-cap (the next 20% of stocks), small-cap (the next 7% of stocks), and micro-cap (the smallest 3% of stocks). Market cap is not always an accurate indication of value because it does not account for debt and other factors.
